Hello, you are in my website's repository

I have never coded in my life. I am a 3D animator and just wanted to code a website to show off my work.
You will notice that my code is a bit bad. Please do not make fun of me
I am trying to learn how to do a site myself to avoid being dependant on a third party website creator
it's a bit DIY, but I like it

Dont ask me how my code works, I'm using Github Copilot for most of the coding.
It works okay for my needs.

I invite you to check out my website and see what i actually do lol
I promis i'm better at animating than HTML
